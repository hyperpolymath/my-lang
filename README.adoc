*Let learning unfold. Let types guard. Let agents compose.*

Progressive-disclosure programming language with first-class AI integration—four dialects scaling from visual blocks to agentic orchestration.

'''

toc::[]

== Who This Is For

[cols="1,3"]
|===
|*Me-curious* |Educators seeking visual programming that secretly teaches affine types and reversible computation
|*Solo practitioners* |Developers wanting Rust-level safety with Python-level approachability—human-first, AI-assisted
|*Duet partners* |Teams exploring balanced human-AI pair programming with explicit collaboration protocols
|*Ensemble conductors* |Architects orchestrating multi-agent systems with neurosymbolic grammar extensions
|===

== The Four Dialects

My is not four languages—it is one language with *progressive reveal*. Concepts introduced as playful metaphors in Me unmask their CS foundations as learners advance.

[cols="1,1,2,2"]
|===
|Dialect |Stage |Mode |Core Insight

|*Me*
|Visual (ages 8-12)
|Blockly-like drag-and-drop
|Resources as colored tokens; affine types as "use once" rules

|*Solo*
|Text (ages 13+)
|Human-first, AI-assists
|Explicit affine/linear types, checkpoint/rollback, cut operators

|*Duet*
|Collaborative
|Balanced co-creation
|Two-party protocols, neurosymbolic extensions

|*Ensemble*
|Orchestration
|AI-leads, human-refines
|Full agentic composition, Newtonian spectrum agents
|===

== Why My?

[source,my]
----
// Type-safe AI with effect tracking
fn summarize(text: String) -> AI<String> {
    ai query {
        prompt: "Summarize concisely"
        context: text
        model: claude
    }
}

// Affine types prevent resource bugs
fn transfer(affine token: Token) -> Result {
    checkpoint save_state {
        let result = process(move token);  // must move, can't copy
        if !result.is_ok() {
            rollback save_state;
        }
        return result;
    }
}

// Cut operator for parser commitment
fn parse(input: String) -> Expr {
    match input {
        "(" => { let e = parse_nested(); !; expect(")"); e },
        _ => parse_simple()
    }
}

=== Technical Differentiators

[cols="2,3"]
|===
|*AI as First-Class Citizen* |Native `ai!` expressions, typed `AI<T>` return values, prompt templates with effect tracking
|*Progressive Safety* |Optional affine/linear types—start simple, add safety constraints as complexity grows
|*Reversible Computation* |Checkpoint/rollback at language level, not library level
|*Prolog-Heritage Parsing* |Cut operator (`!`) for committed choice in recursive descent
|*Neurosymbolic Bridge* |Duet dialect enables explicit symbolic-neural protocol boundaries
|===

== Quick Start

[source,bash]
----
# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/hyperpolymath/my-lang
cd my-lang
cargo build --release

# Run the REPL
cargo run -- repl

# Run a program
cargo run -- run examples/hello.my

# Build a static site with My SSG
cd my-ssg && cargo run -- new my-blog
----

== Architecture

== Ecosystem Integration

My participates in the *poly-mcp* constellation:

[cols="1,2"]
|===
|https://github.com/hyperpolymath/poly-ssg-mcp[poly-ssg-mcp] |MCP hub for static site generators—My SSG exposes `my_init`, `my_build`, `my_serve`
|https://github.com/hyperpolymath/poly-container-mcp[poly-container-mcp] |Multi-runtime container management
|https://github.com/hyperpolymath/poly-iac-mcp[poly-iac-mcp] |Infrastructure-as-code MCP servers
|===

My SSG is one satellite in the broader poly-ssg ecosystem alongside Eclipse (Pony), Tyrano (TypeScript→ReScript migration), and others.

== Newtonian Spectrum

In Ensemble mode, seven specialized agents—colored by Newton's spectrum—orchestrate compilation and execution:

[cols="1,2,2"]
|===
|Color |Role |Solo Foundation

|Red |Performance (hot paths) |Optimized parser
|Orange |Concurrency (async) |Async/await runtime
|Yellow |Contracts (safety) |Affine type tracking
|Green |Config (schema) |Structured AST
|Blue |Audit (trace) |Checkpoint system
|Indigo |Comptime (meta) |Compile-time evaluation
|Violet |Governance (policy) |Mode declarations
|===

== Status

|Solo dialect (human-first) |Complete
|Lexer, Parser, Type Checker |Complete
|Interpreter & REPL |Complete
|AI Runtime (mock) |Complete
