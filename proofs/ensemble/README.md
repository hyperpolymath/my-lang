# Ensemble Dialect: Formal Specification

The **Ensemble** dialect provides full agentic composition with the Newtonian
spectrum of seven specialized AI agents, enabling AI-led orchestration with
human refinement.

## Contents

1. [Agent Calculus](agent-calculus/) - π-calculus based agent theory
2. [Orchestration](orchestration/) - Multi-agent coordination
3. [Spectrum Theory](spectrum-theory/) - Newtonian agent formalization

## Overview

Ensemble introduces advanced orchestration concepts:

- **Newtonian spectrum**: Seven specialized AI agents (ROYGBIV)
- **Multi-agent composition**: Complex agent interactions
- **AI-led orchestration**: AI coordinates, human refines
- **Emergent behavior**: System-level properties from agent interaction

## The Newtonian Spectrum

Seven agents corresponding to light spectrum colors:

| Agent | Color | Responsibility |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| **Red** | 🔴 | Performance - optimized hot paths |
| **Orange** | 🟠 | Concurrency - async/await runtime |
| **Yellow** | 🟡 | Contracts - safety/affine type tracking |
| **Green** | 🟢 | Config - schema management |
| **Blue** | 🔵 | Audit - checkpoint/trace system |
| **Indigo** | 🟣 | Comptime - compile-time evaluation |
| **Violet** | 💜 | Governance - mode/policy declarations |

## Design Philosophy

### From Duet to Ensemble

- **Duet**: Two parties (human + AI) in balanced collaboration
- **Ensemble**: Many agents orchestrated by AI, refined by human

### Emergent Intelligence

Complex behavior emerges from simple agent interactions:
- Agents have focused responsibilities
- Communication follows typed protocols
- Composition creates sophisticated systems

## Key Theorems

- **Theorem 1 (Agent Safety)**: Each agent respects its type interface
- **Theorem 2 (Composition Safety)**: Agent composition preserves invariants
- **Theorem 3 (Orchestration Correctness)**: Orchestration achieves goals
- **Theorem 4 (Termination)**: Well-formed orchestrations terminate
- **Theorem 5 (Spectrum Completeness)**: ROYGBIV covers necessary concerns

## Relationship to Other Dialects

- **From Duet**: Generalizes two-party to multi-party
- **Complete**: Ensemble is the full expression of My Language
